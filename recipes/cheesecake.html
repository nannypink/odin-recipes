<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<h2>For the crust</h2>
<ul>
    <li>2 cups blanched almond flour </li>
    <li>⅓ cup butter, melted </li>
    <li>3 tablespoons powdered erythritol sweetener </li>
    <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract </li>
</ul>
<h2>For the filling:</h2>
    <li>4 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese, softened </li>
    <li>1 ¼ cups powdered erythritol sweetener </li>
    <li>3 large eggs </li>
    <li>1 tablespoon lemon juice </li>
    <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract </li>
    <li>¼ teaspoon lemon zest </li>
</ul> 

<h2>Method</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9-inch springform pan and line the bottom with parchment paper. Wrap the bottom and sides of the pan with aluminum foil if worried about leakage.  </li>
    <li>Stir almond flour, butter, erythritol, and vanilla extract together in a small bowl until well combined; the mixture will be crumbly. Press into the prepared pan bottom.  </li>
    <li>Bake on the center rack in the preheated oven until just golden, 10 to 12 minutes. Allow to cool for 10 minutes.  </li>
    <li>Meanwhile, beat cream cheese and powdered sweetener together using an electric stand or hand mixer at low speed until fluffy. Beat in eggs, one at a time. Add lemon juice, vanilla extract, and lemon zest; beat until well combined.  </li>
    <li>Bake on the center rack in the preheated oven until almost set and slightly jiggly in the center, 45 to 55 minutes. </li>    
    <li>Remove from the oven and let cool in the pan. Keep in the pan, cover, and refrigerate to fully set, at least 4 hours to overnight. Run a knife gently around the sides, unclamp, and carefully remove the pan; it should come right off.  </li>
